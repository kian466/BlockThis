# Instructions
A robot is about to randomly shoot an arrow at you, use your mouse to click in one out of the three square areas to place your shield in and see if you guess correctly on which box the robot will shoot in. Guess right and you are awarded with +1 point = 1 Treasure. Guess wrong and your score will reset.
